## Introduction
The vehicle control unit makes all of the decisions in the car. It reads the pedals, the brake pressure, the driver inputs and any other analog or resistive sensor in the vheicle. It receives an abundance of data over the CANbus about performance and temperatures of other vehicle aspects. It runs the traction control algorithms. It’s responsible for the control and power of the brake lights, pumps and cooling fans. And ultimately, it’s responsible for sending the motor torque requests over CAN to drive the vehicle.
