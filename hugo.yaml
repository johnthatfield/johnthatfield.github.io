          During my time as Tractive System Lead Engineer, I was responsible for integrating the inverters and motors into <a href="https://qutmotorsport.com/qev-3d/" target="_blank">QEV-3</a>. QEV-3 has seen many iterations and upgrades of its 72V tractive system and has proven to be a reliable test platform. It is currently being used by the Driverless team as a fully autonomous vehicle.
          
          As the Electrical Team Lead I was responsible for overseeing the design of all vehicle systems of our new vehicle, <a href="https://qutmotorsport.com/qev-4/" target="_blank">QEV-4</a>. This included:
          - Design of low voltage control and 600V electronics, including our teams <a href="https://johnhatfield.substack.com/p/electric-vehicle-control-unit" target="_blank">vehicle control unit (VCU)</a>. Altium Designer.
          - Design and assembly of control and power wiring assemblies. Rapid Harness. Deutsch. Amphenol. Molex.
          - Design and construction of 600V battery pack

          I joined Boeing Defence Australia in April 2019 as an intern in the product support and maintenance capability. I worked on a variety of data analysis, modelling and simulation projects, supporting Boeing's different sustainment programs.

          In January 2021 I took a 6 month stint to work in <a href="https://www.boeing.com.au/products-services/Defense-Space-Security/currawong.page" target="_blank">Project Currawong</a>, performing integration testing and debugging on deployable communications hardware.

          In July 2021 I returned to the product support and maintenance capability, where I led the development of a Fleet Planning tool. This web tool involved a simulation and optimiser, enabling fleet planners to simulate different scenarios, comparing performance and maintenance. In late 2022 during the development of this tool, I was promoted to Support System Technologist.
