This enables better delivery of torque and torque vectoring. As a result, these already small vehicles now have 4 relatively low powered motors. There are some existing solutions used by teams, such as the Bucher 60kW dual control unit, the Sevcon HVLP 20, and the VESC 100/250. However, these drives are made for auxiliary pumps and fans in larger buses and tractors, not meeting the packaging or performance requirements, or in the case of the VESC, designed for a skateboard, and so lacks the isolated safety requirements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe goal of this project was to design a robust, power-dense motor control solution that can fit into small vehicle spaces. The solution should minimise unnecessary complexity, focusing on delivering working and validated hardware\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"initial-design\"\u003eInitial Design\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRefer to thesis\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"solution\"\u003eSolution\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe final device assembly is shown below, with control board on top, interface breakout, gate drives and power PCB on the bottom.

When the voltage is below zero the light should be solid green indicating a safe state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe TSAL must be visible in daylight from a distance, meaning fairly high powered LEDs are required.

Traditionally QUT Motorsport placed their TSAL control board in the battery assembly on the vehicle side of the DC contactors. However, with the battery pack removed there is still a large capacitance in the vehicle at the motor controllers that could remain live for 10+ minutes if the discharge system fails. For this reason, the decision was made to place the TSAL control in the vehicle junction box, meaning the TSAL will show accurate tractive system voltage stage even with the battery pack removed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"solution\"\u003eSolution\u003c/h1\u003e\n","description":null,"image":null,"permalink":"https://example.org/projects/tsal/","title":"Tractive System Active Light (TSAL)"},{"content":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vehicle control unit makes all of the decisions in the car. It reads the pedals, the brake pressure, the driver inputs and any other analog or resistive sensor in the vheicle. It receives an abundance of data over the CANbus about performance and temperatures of other vehicle aspects. It runs the traction control algorithms. It’s responsible for the control and power of the brake lights, pumps and cooling fans. And ultimately, it’s responsible for sending the motor torque requests over CAN to drive the vehicle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor now, check out my blog post on the VCU at \u003ca href=\"https://johnhatfield.substack.com/p/electric-vehicle-control-unit\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSubstack\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- ![Scope Close Up](/images/inverter/measurement_close.jpg \"Scope Close Up\") --\u003e","description":null,"image":null,"permalink":"https://example.org/projects/vcu/","title":"Vehicle Control Unit (VCU)"}]
